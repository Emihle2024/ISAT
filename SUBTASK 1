2. GitHub Codespaces**: A cloud-based development environment that provides a ready-to-use, configurable workspace directly within GitHub.
3. GitHub Discussions**: A feature for community interaction and collaboration, allowing for open-ended conversations and Q&A within repositories.

Key Features of GitLab

1. Built-in CI/CD**: GitLab integrates CI/CD tools directly into its core platform, providing a seamless experience for pipeline creation and management.
2. Auto DevOps**: GitLab offers Auto DevOps, which automatically configures CI/CD pipelines based on best practices and integrates with monitoring and security tools.
3. Built-in Container Registry**: GitLab includes a container registry for Docker images, making it easy to manage and deploy containerized applications.

Core Distinction in Licensing Approaches

- GitHub**: GitHub is primarily a commercial platform, although it offers free accounts with unlimited public repositories. GitHubâ€™s features are available through various pricing tiers, including free and paid plans. It does not offer a fully open-source version of its platform; however, GitHub Enterprise is available for self-hosted deployments with a commercial license.

- GitLab**: GitLab offers a more flexible licensing approach, with a community edition that is open-source and available for self-hosting. This community edition includes many core features. Additionally, GitLab provides various paid tiers with additional features and enterprise support, including GitLab Ultimate and GitLab Premium.

Unique Features of GitHub

1. GitHub Sponsors**: A feature that allows developers to financially support open-source projects and contributors directly through the platform.
2. GitHub Marketplace**: A marketplace offering various third-party apps and tools that can integrate with GitHub to enhance functionality and productivity.

Unique Features of GitLab

1. GitLab Auto DevOps: This feature automatically configures CI/CD pipelines based on best practices without requiring extensive manual setup.
2. GitLab Kubernetes Integration**: GitLab provides deep integration with Kubernetes, allowing users to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes clusters directly from GitLab.

Both platforms have their strengths, and the choice between GitHub and GitLab often comes down to specific needs and preferences regarding integration, licensing, and feature sets.
